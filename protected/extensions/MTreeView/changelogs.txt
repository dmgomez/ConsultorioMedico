MTreeView Change Logs

v2.1
 - the style of the selected can be set upon widget call using the added property 'selectedStyle'
 - added the property 'ajaxOptions' so it can render ajaxLinks if the said property is given (see @CHtml::ajaxOptions)
 - improved the comparison of the selected url with each node's url
 - fixed the rendering of htmlOptions when the node has no link

v2
 - added the option 'encode' (bool), which will CHtml::encode() the node if set to true
 - edited some codes
 - changed the template default to {icon} {text}" (added space in between)
 - removed the field 'position' as one of the selected field to avoid errors in query
 - fixed the indentation. Proper indentation is lost when file is opened in other editors such as Notepad++.
 - redeclared the static variables to its default values so as not to affect other MTreeView especially when rendered in a single page.
 - allowed declaring of array in url, just like that in Yii::app()->createUrl()
 - revision 1: included the 'options' field even in processing the fields when the url is array and if 'options' is given
 
v1.1
 - added 'options' among the fields, which will serve as the htmlOptions for each node. Affects both hierarch models and AJAX calls
 - added $nodeOptions in formatLinks() - revision 2: fixed the reset value of $_template_ (thanks to Timbo)
 
v1
 - initial release
